equal = \ x y .
when x is 1of2
  when y is 1of2 should return 2of2
  when y is 2of2 should return 1of2
when x is 2of2
  when y is 1of2  should return  1of2
  when y is 2of2  should return 2of2


when x is 1of2  should return flip y
when x is 2of2 it should return y

flip = \ chooser . chooser 2of2 1of2

equal = \ x y . x A B

equal = \ x y . x (flip y) y

1of2 yes no
x yes no

eq3 a b c returns whether all 3 are equal
mult is the same as min

maxOrMin which (chooser) a b returns, using which, returns max or min

maxorMin 1of2 a b returns min a b
maxorMin 2of2 a b returns max a b
