#The next problem is to define "equals" which treats a chooser like a "bit", 1of2 is "off" or "false" and 2of2 is "on" or "true".

#equals a b takes two choosers and returns 2of2 (true) the choosers are equal and 1of2 (false) if they are not.

#So equals 1of2 1of2 would return 2of2 and equals 1of2 2of2 would return 1of2.

1of2 = \ x y . x
2of2 = \ x y . y




max = \ x y . x y x
test20 = max 1of2 1of2
#. 1of2 1of2 1of2
# does 1of2                 should return 1of2

test21 = max 1of2 2of2
#. 1of2 2of2 1of2    does 2of2              should return 2of2

test22 = max 2of2 1of2
#. 2of2 1of2 2of2  does 2of2               should return 2of2

test23 = max 2of2 2of2
#. 2of2 2of2 2of2 does 2of2      should return 2of2
