mult = \ x y . x 1of2 y  multiplies all 3

max = \ x y . y 1of2 2of2 is returning the second one

test4 = max 1of2 1of2  should return 1of2 it does
test5 = max 1of2 2of2 should return 2of2 it does
test6 = max 2of2 1of2  should return 2of2 it does not
test7 = max 2of2 2of2  should return 2of2 it does
is it always returning second value?

1-0   =1 return 1
0-0 = 0 return 0

x>y  1>0
if multiplied is 1, answer is 1
if multiplied is 0 could be either

0*1  1
1*0  0 --
1*1  1
0*0  0

0+1  =1    return 1
1+0   =1 return 1

returns both?
