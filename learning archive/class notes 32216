1of2:  λx y . x
1of2 a b    ⇒    a

1of2 a b this is calling the function with the values, or running the function,
 applying the function to the values

flip 1of2 => 2of2
flip 2of2 => 1of2

2of2 a b => b
(flip 1of2) a b => b  this is a spec

1of2 = \ x y . x
2of2 = \ x y . y
flip = \ chooser . chooser 2of2 1of2
chooser is a variable that will be given a value, chooser is called a parameter
test = (flip 1of2) a b
mult = \ x y . x 1of2 y   calling x with 2 arguments
test2 = mult 1of2 2of2 => 1of2
test3 = mult 2of2 2of2 => 2of2

we did minimum program 1 0, write a max program
