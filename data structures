         person is a two argument function that returns a function of one argument
         the returned function takes an "accessor" function as its one argument
         accessor is a function of two arguments
         when you call person's returned function with an accessor you provide, it calls your accessor with name and age

p1 = createPerson bob 54 <--- p1 is a one-argument function!
p2 = createPerson mary 73

getName = \ aPerson . aPerson 1of2
getAge = \ aPerson . aPerson 2of2
body is after the dot
arguments are between slash and dot
